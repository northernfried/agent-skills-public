## Internal Authorship (non-external, listed for completeness)

Several skills carry a generic internal-team byline rather than a named external source — these were authored in-house rather than adapted from a public source, so there's no external link to credit:

- "Workspace Delivery Skills", "Workspace Strategy Skills", "Workspace Refinement Skills", "Workspace Governance Skills" — internal authoring placeholders across `skills/delivery/`, `skills/Strategy/`, `skills/Refinement/`, `skills/governance/`
- "PM Team" — `skills/product/competitor-analysis-synthesizer.md`, `skills/delivery/jira-epic-builder.md`, `skills/governance/defect-triage-assistant.md`
