# Skill Name: Annual Goals and Quarterly Objectives

## Objective

Helps product leadership define annual goals and objectives, translate them into quarterly measurable outcomes, and establish an operating cadence for reviewing and adjusting them during the year.

## Target Persona

Chief Product Officer, Head of Product, Product Director, Portfolio Lead, General Manager

## Inputs Required

- Strategy horizon for the year.
- Business priorities, growth targets, risk constraints, and board or leadership expectations.
- Product portfolio context and major commercial commitments.
- Known market windows, campaigns, regulatory dates, and seasonal events.
- Current baseline performance, customer feedback, and delivery constraints.

## SMART Criteria Reference (annual goals and quarterly checkpoints)

Every annual goal and quarterly checkpoint should satisfy SMART:

| Letter | Question to answer | Common failure mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **S**pecific | Who's involved, what exactly will be accomplished, and why does it matter? Use concrete action verbs (own, launch, reduce, migrate, certify) rather than bare directional verbs alone ("improve," "increase") that don't say what action produces the change. | Goal describes a direction, not an action ("improve customer service") |
| **M**easurable | What data source proves this happened? Set intermediate milestones for anything spanning more than a few months, not just an end-state number. | No named data source; success is a matter of opinion |
| **A**chievable | Given current skills, resources, and delivery capacity, is this realistic — a stretch, not a stunt? | Goal ignores known capacity constraints |
| **R**elevant | Does this ladder up to a broader business/strategic priority the organization has actually prioritized this cycle? | Goal is technically achievable but not something leadership is currently funding or prioritizing |
| **T**ime-bound | What's the deadline, and what should be true at the halfway point? | Deadline exists but no mid-point checkpoint, so drift isn't caught until it's too late |

Scoping guidance:
- 3-6 annual goals is the right range — goals should cover the major buckets of responsibility, not every initiative underneath them.
- Too many goals is itself a signal: it usually means goals are scoped at the task level instead of the outcome level. If the list is growing past ~6, look for goals that should be combined into one broader outcome.
- A goal statement is not the same as its action plan — capture the "how" as supporting initiatives underneath the goal, not as additional goals.

## INVEST Check for Quarterly Objectives and Initiatives

Once an annual goal is broken into quarterly initiatives (or further into team-level backlog items), run each one through INVEST — originally a user-story quality checklist, equally useful for checking that a quarterly objective is actually well-formed and executable rather than aspirational:

- **Independent** — can this initiative progress and be evaluated without waiting on another initiative to finish first?
- **Negotiable** — is the initiative a discussion point the team can refine (approach, scope) rather than a fixed, over-specified contract handed down?
- **Valuable** — does it deliver clear, nameable value on its own, not just as a means to some other unstated goal?
- **Estimable** — can the owning team reasonably size the effort required?
- **Small** — does it fit inside the quarter (or a checkpoint within it) rather than spanning multiple quarters unbroken?
- **Testable** — is there a clear, verifiable condition for "this is done," even before the work starts?

If a quarterly initiative fails Independent or Small, it's usually a sign the annual goal needs to be decomposed further before it reaches a team.

## Expected Output

- Annual goal set with clear objective statements.
- Quarterly outcome measures and checkpoints for each annual goal.
- Leading and lagging indicators for progress tracking.
- Adjustment triggers that require re-planning or goal correction.
- Explicit assumptions, dependencies, and trade-offs.

## Core Prompt / Instructions

```text
You are a product leadership strategy advisor helping define annual goals and quarterly objectives.

I will provide business context, portfolio direction, and planning constraints.

Produce the result in this order:
1. Summarize the annual strategic context.
2. Define the 3-6 most important annual goals. Write each as a SMART
   statement (see SMART Criteria Reference): a concrete action verb, a
   named data source that proves it happened, a stated deadline, an
   explicit tie to a broader business priority, and a stated reality-check
   on capacity/skills.
3. For each goal, define:
   - why it matters (the Relevant tie-in)
   - target outcome by year end (the Specific + Measurable statement)
   - quarterly checkpoints and measures, including a mid-point milestone,
     not just the year-end number
   - leading indicators and lagging indicators
4. Break each goal into its quarterly initiatives and run each one through
   the INVEST check (see INVEST Check section). Flag any initiative that
   fails Independent or Small as needing further decomposition before it
   goes to a team.
5. Identify dependencies, assumptions, and risks that may affect progress.
6. Recommend what should be reviewed each quarter and what would trigger
   adjustment.
7. Highlight where goals compete for funding, leadership attention, or
   delivery capacity.

Rules:
- Keep annual goals outcome-based, not activity-based — if the list is
  growing past ~6, look for goals that should be combined rather than
  adding another one.
- Every goal statement must pass the SMART check; every quarterly
  initiative under it must pass the INVEST check.
- Make quarterly measures specific enough to evaluate progress, with at
  least one mid-cycle checkpoint for anything spanning more than a quarter.
- Separate what must be true by year end from what should be achieved each
  quarter.
- Surface trade-offs if too many annual goals compete for the same capacity.
```

## Success Criteria / Quality Checklist

- [ ] Annual goals are outcome-based and leadership-relevant.
- [ ] Every annual goal passes the SMART check (specific action verb, named data source, stated capacity reality-check, explicit tie to a current business priority, deadline plus a mid-point checkpoint).
- [ ] Every quarterly initiative passes the INVEST check, especially Independent and Small — anything that fails either is decomposed further, not left as-is.
- [ ] Quarterly checkpoints make progress measurable.
- [ ] Review triggers are explicit.
- [ ] Dependencies and trade-offs are visible.
- [ ] Goals can be adjusted without losing annual intent.
