# Skill Name: Product Proposal Viability Scoring & Refinement Gate

## Objective

Scores a new product/service/solution proposal's viability using three inputs together — where it lands on the lifecycle x value-hierarchy grid, how strongly it's weighted against declared organizational strategy, and the quality of the evidence behind it — and produces an explicit gate decision on whether the proposal is ready to move into refinement. Direct-revenue proposals are gated on a quantitative study with named measurables; indirect-revenue proposals lead with qualitative narrative but are still required to commit to specific, measurable assumptions rather than open-ended claims.

## Target Persona

Chief Product Officer, Head of Product, Portfolio Lead, Strategy Lead, Product Manager sponsoring a new proposal — anyone deciding whether an idea is ready to leave "proposal" and enter refinement (`Refinement/` skills take over from there).

## Inputs Required

- The proposal itself: what it is, and its offering type (Product/Service/Solution).
- Its placement on the lifecycle x value-hierarchy grid (`product-lifecycle-hierarchy-evaluation-matrix.md`).
- Its revenue classification — Direct or Indirect (`product-revenue-tier-investment-case.md`).
- The organization's current declared strategic priorities and verticals (`product-strategy-and-business-focus.md`).
- Whatever quantitative or qualitative evidence already exists for the proposal.

## Expected Output

- A grid-position sanity check (is the proposal aiming at a structurally viable cell, or a rare/weak one?)
- A strategic alignment weight, tied to named priorities — not a generic "this seems important" judgment
- Either: a completed quantitative study meeting the stated evidence bar (Direct revenue), or a fully specified set of measurable assumptions with baselines and targets (Indirect revenue)
- An explicit gate decision: ready for refinement, not yet, or rejected — with the specific reason

## Core Prompt / Instructions

```text
You are scoring a product/service/solution proposal's viability before it is
allowed to enter refinement. Work through these steps in order.

1. GRID POSITION AS A FIRST-PASS SANITY CHECK
   Place the proposal on the lifecycle x value-hierarchy grid
   (`product-lifecycle-hierarchy-evaluation-matrix.md`). New proposals
   almost always start at Introduction — the real question is which tier:
     - Introduction/Transformational or Introduction/Strategic: the normal,
       viable entry points for new ideas. Expect thin initial evidence;
       that's inherent to the cell, not a red flag on its own.
     - Introduction/Foundational: a structurally weak cell — the matrix
       skill notes this is rare because nothing sane enters at table-stakes
       with zero track record. A proposal landing here should be challenged
       hard: is this actually closing a competitive-parity gap (the one
       recognized exception in `product-revenue-tier-investment-case.md`),
       or is it just an unconvincing idea dressed up as strategy?
     - Introduction/Efficiency: viable, but confirm the efficiency claim is
       real and not assumed.
   State the grid position and whether it's a normal or a challenged entry
   point before doing anything else.

2. STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT WEIGHT
   Rate the proposal against the organization's CURRENTLY DECLARED
   priorities and verticals (`product-strategy-and-business-focus.md`) —
   not against a generic sense of "good ideas." Use three bands, and name
   which specific priority the proposal maps to (or doesn't):
     - CORE — directly advances a named, current-year strategic priority
     - ADJACENT — supports a priority indirectly, or serves a segment
       adjacent to a named priority
     - PERIPHERAL — doesn't map to any currently declared priority
   A PERIPHERAL rating isn't automatically disqualifying, but it raises the
   evidence bar in step 3/4 — an unaligned proposal needs stronger proof to
   justify capacity, not a free pass because "it's a good idea."

3. DIRECT-REVENUE PROPOSALS — THE QUANTITATIVE STUDY
   If the proposal is classified Direct revenue, it needs an actual study,
   not a narrative pitch. The study must produce:
     a. PROBLEM SIZING — addressable segment size, number of clients/deals
        affected, and evidence the pain is real today (support tickets,
        churn attributable to this gap, lost-deal reasons citing it) —
        sourced, not asserted.
     b. MARKET/PRICING COMPARABLES — what similar capabilities are priced
        at elsewhere, cited (see `product-revenue-tier-investment-case.md`
        for the sourcing/access-tier discipline).
     c. A TESTABLE HYPOTHESIS WITH A STATED THRESHOLD — e.g. "X% of segment
        Y adopts within Z months at $ price point, based on comparable
        analog A" — not "this will help" with no number attached.
     d. FOR TRULY NOVEL CELLS (Introduction/Transformational, where no
        market comparable exists yet): substitute design-partner validation
        for market comparables — named prospective clients, letters of
        intent, or committed pilots stand in for pricing/market data that
        doesn't exist yet. A transformational idea with zero prospective
        client validation is a hunch, not a study.
   MINIMUM EVIDENCE BAR to pass the gate: sourced problem sizing, at least
   one comparable OR validated design-partner signal, and a hypothesis with
   a stated, falsifiable threshold. Missing any of these means "not yet,"
   not "proceed on faith."

4. INDIRECT-REVENUE PROPOSALS — QUALITATIVE-LED, STILL MEASURABLE
   If the proposal is classified Indirect revenue, the case may lead with
   qualitative narrative — there's no client-facing price to study. But it
   must still commit to specific measurable assumptions, each with a
   baseline, a target, a measurement method, and a post-launch validation
   checkpoint. At minimum, require the proposal to name and quantify
   whichever of these actually apply:
     - REDUCTION IN TIME-TO-REVENUE — e.g. "reduces average deal cycle from
       X days to Y days" or "cuts onboarding time from X weeks to Y weeks."
       State the current baseline explicitly; don't accept "faster" alone.
     - CLIENT EXPERIENCE ENHANCEMENT, EXPRESSED AS RETENTION/ATTRITION —
       e.g. "expected to reduce churn in segment X from A% to B%" or "raise
       retention/NPS by N points." A claim of "better experience" with no
       retention or attrition number attached does not meet this bar.
     - AVERAGE CONSUMPTION PATTERN INCREASE — e.g. "expected to increase
       average usage/consumption per account by N% within M months,"
       sourced from current usage telemetry as the baseline.
   Qualitative input (interviews, anecdotes, stakeholder sentiment) is
   legitimate to MOTIVATE these assumptions and explain the mechanism — it
   is never a substitute for stating them as numbers with a baseline and a
   target. Any assumption without a stated baseline and target is not yet
   gate-ready, regardless of how compelling the narrative is.

5. THE GATE DECISION
   Combine the three inputs into one explicit decision, stated plainly:
     - READY FOR REFINEMENT — viable grid position (or a labeled parity
       exception), a stated strategic alignment band, and either a
       quantitative study meeting the step 3 bar or a fully specified
       measurable-assumptions set meeting the step 4 bar.
     - NOT YET — the idea may be sound but evidence is incomplete; name
       exactly what's missing (which of steps 1-4 didn't clear).
     - REJECTED — a challenged grid position with no parity justification,
       or a PERIPHERAL strategic fit with an evidence bar that isn't met.
   Refinement should never start on narrative alone, regardless of how
   senior the sponsor or how exciting the idea sounds.

Now apply this to the described proposal:
Proposal and offering type: $PROPOSAL
Grid position (if already assessed): $GRID_POSITION
Revenue classification (Direct/Indirect): $REVENUE_CLASSIFICATION
Current strategic priorities to weigh against: $STRATEGIC_PRIORITIES
Available evidence (quantitative or qualitative): $AVAILABLE_EVIDENCE
```

## Success Criteria / Quality Checklist

- [ ] Grid position is stated explicitly, and a challenged cell (e.g. Introduction/Foundational) is either justified as a parity exception or flagged hard
- [ ] Strategic alignment is rated Core/Adjacent/Peripheral against NAMED current priorities, not a generic quality judgment
- [ ] Direct-revenue proposals include sourced problem sizing, at least one comparable or validated design-partner signal, and a falsifiable hypothesis with a stated threshold
- [ ] Indirect-revenue proposals name and quantify every applicable measurable assumption (time-to-revenue, retention/attrition, consumption pattern) with a baseline and a target — never left as unquantified narrative
- [ ] Qualitative input is used only to motivate the assumptions above, never to replace their baseline/target figures
- [ ] The gate decision is explicit — Ready / Not Yet / Rejected — with the specific missing evidence named if not Ready
- [ ] A Peripheral-strategy proposal is held to the same or a higher evidence bar, not a lower one
