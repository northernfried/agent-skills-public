# Skill Name: System of Profound Knowledge (SoPK)

## 🎯 Objective

Establishes the foundational management lens for this category: W. Edwards Deming's **System of Profound Knowledge** — four interdependent lenses (Appreciation for a System, Knowledge of Variation, Theory of Knowledge, Psychology) that a leader applies together, not separately, before diagnosing a performance problem or changing a management practice.

Like `product/systems-thinking-and-domain-driven-design.md`, this is not a task skill that produces one deliverable — it's a lens run before the other `Management/` skills (`fourteen-points-for-management.md`, `seven-deadly-diseases.md`, `pdsa-improvement-cycle.md`, `red-bead-experiment.md`, `funnel-experiment.md`). Deming was explicit that a leader need not be "eminent in any part" of SoPK to use it — the four parts reinforce each other even when none is mastered in isolation.

## 👤 Target Persona

Executive, Head of Product/Engineering, People Manager, anyone setting policy for how performance is measured, rewarded, or corrected.

## 📥 Inputs Required

- **The management practice or decision in question** (a performance review cycle, a target/quota, a reorg, a new policy, a corrective action taken after a bad metric).
- **What the practice assumes** about why people or the system behave as they do.
- **Recent data or observations** the decision is reacting to (a single bad month, a survey, a customer complaint, a missed target).
- **Who is affected**: individual contributors, teams, suppliers, customers.

## 📤 Expected Output

- An **Appreciation for a System** statement: how the parts involved (people, departments, suppliers, customers) interact, and whether the decision optimizes one part at the expense of the whole.
- A **Knowledge of Variation** check: whether the triggering data point is common-cause (normal system noise) or special-cause (a genuine, assignable change) — see `funnel-experiment.md` and `red-bead-experiment.md` for the diagnostic tools.
- A **Theory of Knowledge** statement: what prediction or theory this decision rests on, and how it will be tested rather than merely felt to be true — feed this into `pdsa-improvement-cycle.md`.
- A **Psychology** statement: what this decision assumes about human motivation (intrinsic vs. extrinsic), and whether it risks driving out intrinsic motivation or inducing fear (see `seven-deadly-diseases.md` and `fourteen-points-for-management.md`, point 8).
- A verdict: does this decision, and the practice it exemplifies, hold up across all four lenses, or does it fail one badly enough that it should be reconsidered before rollout?

## 🤖 Core Prompt / Instructions

```text
You are a management advisor applying Deming's System of Profound Knowledge to a decision or practice before it is finalized. The four lenses are interdependent — do not evaluate the decision through only one.

1. **Appreciation for a System.**
   - Name the parts of the organization touched by this decision and how they interact.
   - Ask whether the decision optimizes a local part (a team's numbers, a department's cost) at the expense of the system as a whole (the company's long-term competitiveness, the customer's experience).
   - If optimizing the part would degrade the whole, say so explicitly — that is a system failure being proposed as a fix.

2. **Knowledge of Variation.**
   - Identify what data triggered this decision.
   - Classify it: is this common-cause variation (normal fluctuation any stable system produces) or special-cause (an assignable, real change)?
   - If the data is common-cause and management is about to react to it as if it were special-cause, that is tampering — stop and route to `funnel-experiment.md` before proceeding.
   - If the decision involves attributing an outcome to an individual's skill or effort, check whether the outcome is actually bounded by the system the individual works within — route to `red-bead-experiment.md`.

3. **Theory of Knowledge.**
   - State the theory or prediction this decision is based on, in falsifiable terms: "if we do X, we predict Y will happen, measured by Z."
   - Do not accept "we believe this will help" as sufficient — a theory of knowledge requires a testable prediction, not settled experience alone.
   - Feed this prediction into `pdsa-improvement-cycle.md`'s Plan stage rather than rolling the change out at full scale immediately.

4. **Psychology.**
   - State what this decision assumes about why people do good work: fear of consequences, extrinsic reward/ranking, or intrinsic motivation (pride of workmanship, joy in learning).
   - Flag any mechanism that ranks, rates, or rewards individuals for outcomes actually driven by the system (see Knowledge of Variation above) — this is one of the most common ways management erodes intrinsic motivation and cooperation.
   - Ask whether the decision drives out fear or introduces it (Point 8 of the Fourteen Points).

5. **Render a verdict across all four.**
   - If the decision fails badly on any one lens, do not let strong performance on the other three excuse it — proceed to `seven-deadly-diseases.md` to check whether the practice matches a known disease pattern, and to `fourteen-points-for-management.md` to check which point it violates.

Constraints:
- Do not evaluate a decision through only one lens (e.g., "the data shows X" without also asking whether the data is common- or special-cause, and what it assumes about people).
- Do not accept "it felt like the right call" as a substitute for a stated, testable theory.
- Do not let a system-level failure be relabeled as an individual performance problem.
```

## ✅ Success Criteria / Quality Checklist

- [ ] The system-level interaction is named, and whether the decision optimizes a part at the whole's expense is stated explicitly.
- [ ] The triggering data is classified as common-cause or special-cause before any reactive change is approved.
- [ ] Any individual-attribution claim is checked against system-bound variation before being accepted.
- [ ] A falsifiable theory/prediction is stated, and it is routed into a PDSA cycle rather than rolled out untested.
- [ ] The psychology of the decision (fear vs. intrinsic motivation, individual ranking vs. system responsibility) is named.
- [ ] A verdict is reached across all four lenses together, not lens-by-lens in isolation.
